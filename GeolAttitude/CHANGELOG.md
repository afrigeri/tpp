## [0.2.3] - 2026-07-05

### Added

* Compatibility support for QGIS 3.44 and QGIS 4.x API transitions.
* Add unit tests for `PlaneFitter`.
* Add regression tests for dip-direction convention.
* Add tests for invalid point sets, including too few points and collinear points.

### Changed

* Reorganized fitting code into a dedicated `algorithms/` module.
* Improved separation between QGIS interface code and scientific computation code.
* Updated plugin metadata for GeolAttitude version `0.2.3`.
* Improve documentation of geological orientation conventions.
* Clarify that coordinates are interpreted as `x = Easting`, `y = Northing`, `z = elevation`.

### Fixed

* Improved handling of insufficient point selections.
* Improved compatibility with newer QGIS/PyQt enum names.
* Fixed cases where computation could fail silently or return `None`.+
* Fix dip-direction inversion: dip direction should represent the azimuth of steepest descent, measured clockwise from north.
